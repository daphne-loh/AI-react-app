# FoodDrop Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- Launch MVP food collection game within 2-3 months to achieve $5/day revenue target
- Acquire 50+ paying subscribers at $2.99/month through organic growth and retention
- Deliver accessible web-based collection experience eliminating app download barriers
- Provide educational value through cultural food content to justify subscription cost
- Maintain 70%+ monthly subscriber retention through engaging collection mechanics
- Establish foundation for scalable food culture platform and community

### Background Context

The mobile gaming market presents significant barriers for casual collectors through app store friction, storage requirements, and aggressive monetization. FoodDrop addresses this gap by delivering a browser-based food collection game that combines proven gachapon mechanics with educational content about global food culture. The web-first approach eliminates traditional access barriers while the subscription model ($2.99/month) provides predictable revenue requiring only 2 active subscribers to meet the $5/day target. This positioning serves underserved casual collectors who want instant access and low commitment while creating genuine educational value through cultural food exploration.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

FoodDrop delivers a delightful, whimsical collection experience that feels like opening surprise packages from around the world. The interface emphasizes visual appeal and tactile satisfaction through smooth animations and appealing food imagery. Users should feel a sense of anticipation with each gachapon pull and satisfaction when discovering new food items. The educational content is seamlessly integrated, transforming curiosity about food items into learning moments without interrupting the collection flow.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

**Touch-First Gachapon Mechanics**: Primary interaction centers around satisfying touch/tap gestures for "pulling" new food items with visual feedback and animation sequences that build anticipation and deliver rewarding reveals.

**Progressive Discovery**: Interface gradually reveals information layers - initial visual appeal of food items, then cultural context, then detailed recipes - allowing users to dive as deep as their interest permits.

**Collection-Focused Navigation**: Core navigation emphasizes collection progress, themed pack organization, and completion status with minimal distractions from the primary collecting experience.

### Core Screens and Views

**Login/Registration Screen**: Simple authentication flow with email/password options and clear value proposition messaging

**Main Collection Dashboard**: Central hub displaying available themed packs, collection progress, and featured new content with prominent gachapon interaction area

**Gachapon Pull Interface**: Full-screen experience for the core collection mechanic with satisfying animations and reveal sequences

**Food Item Detail View**: Individual food item display with high-quality imagery, cultural background, historical context, and recipe information

**Collection Progress Screen**: Visual overview of all themed packs with completion percentages and achievement celebrations

**User Profile & Settings**: Account management, subscription status, collection statistics, and preference controls

**Subscription Management**: Stripe-integrated billing interface for subscription signup, cancellation, and payment method management

### Accessibility: WCAG AA

Implementing WCAG AA compliance including proper color contrast ratios, keyboard navigation support, screen reader compatibility, and alt text for all food item imagery to ensure inclusive access to the collection experience.

### Branding

Clean, modern interface with warm, inviting colors that complement food photography. Visual style should feel approachable and educational rather than gamified or aggressive. Typography should be clear and readable across mobile devices. Food item imagery takes visual priority with supporting UI elements remaining subtle and supportive.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

Mobile-first responsive design optimized for smartphone usage but scaling effectively to tablet and desktop. Touch interactions designed for mobile with appropriate sizing for tablet and mouse/trackpad alternatives for desktop users.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo

Single repository containing React frontend with organized folder structure for components, services, data models, and Firebase configuration. This approach simplifies development workflow for solo developer while maintaining clear code organization.

### Service Architecture

**Frontend**: React.js single-page application with Create React App foundation for rapid development and built-in optimization features.

**Backend**: Firebase serverless architecture utilizing Authentication, Firestore database, Cloud Functions for subscription webhooks and content delivery automation, and Cloud Storage for food item images.

**Payment Processing**: Stripe integration handling all subscription billing, payment method management, and PCI compliance requirements.

**Content Delivery**: Firebase Cloud Functions triggered weekly to unlock new themed food packs for active subscribers with automated email notifications.

### Testing Requirements

**Unit + Integration Testing**: Jest testing framework for React components and Firebase integration testing for critical user flows including authentication, subscription management, and content delivery. Focus on core business logic and user experience paths while maintaining development velocity for solo developer constraints.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

**Progressive Web App (PWA) Implementation**: Service worker configuration for offline capability and app-like experience without native app development overhead.

**Firebase Free Tier Optimization**: Database structure and query patterns designed to minimize Firestore read operations and stay within free tier limits during MVP phase.

**Image Optimization Strategy**: Food item images optimized for web delivery with multiple resolution support for different device types and connection speeds.

**React Component Architecture**: Reusable component library for collection displays, progress indicators, and food item cards to accelerate development and maintain consistency.

**State Management**: React Context API for global state management of user authentication, collection progress, and subscription status without additional library dependencies.

**CSS Framework Decision**: CSS Grid and Flexbox for responsive layouts with custom CSS for food collection specific animations and interactions.

**Development Environment**: Visual Studio Code with React, Firebase, and Stripe extensions for efficient solo development workflow.

**Deployment Strategy**: Firebase Hosting for production deployment with automatic SSL, global CDN, and integration with Firebase services.

**Social Media Integration**: Web Share API and platform-specific sharing URLs for Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram with dynamically generated share content including food item images, cultural facts, and promotional messaging to drive organic user acquisition.
