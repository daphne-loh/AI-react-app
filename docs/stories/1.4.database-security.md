# Story 1.4: Database Structure and Security

## Status
**Current Status:** Draft _(owned by scrum-master, editable by scrum-master, dev-agent)_

## Story

**As a** system administrator,  
**I want** the user data to be securely stored with proper access controls,  
**so that** user information is protected and GDPR compliance is maintained.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Firestore security rules implemented allowing users to read/write only their own data
2. User profile document structure defined in Firestore with proper field types
3. Database indexes configured for efficient user queries
4. GDPR-compliant data collection notice and basic privacy policy page
5. User data encryption in transit and at rest through Firebase security features
6. Basic audit logging for user registration and authentication events
7. Data retention policies documented for future compliance requirements
8. Database backup and recovery procedures established
9. Performance monitoring for database operations implemented
10. Data validation rules to ensure data integrity

## Dev Notes

**Database Architecture Context:**
- **Primary Database**: Firestore NoSQL with real-time capabilities
- **Security Model**: Firebase Authentication + Firestore Security Rules
- **Data Structure**: Document-based with user subcollections
- **Compliance**: GDPR-ready with data export/deletion capabilities

**Firestore Collection Structure:**
```
users/{userId} {
  uid: string,
  email: string,
  displayName?: string,
  emailVerified: boolean,
  createdAt: timestamp,
  lastLoginAt: timestamp,
  preferences: {
    emailNotifications: boolean,
    theme: 'light' | 'dark',
    language: string
  },
  stats: {
    totalItemsCollected: number,
    completedCollections: number,
    joinDate: timestamp
  },
  subscriptionStatus: 'none' | 'active' | 'cancelled',
  gdprConsent: {
    given: boolean,
    timestamp: timestamp,
    version: string
  }
}

users/{userId}/collections/{collectionId} {
  foodItemId: string,
  collectedAt: timestamp,
  discoveryMethod: string,
  viewedEducationalContent: boolean,
  shared: boolean
}

analytics/audit-logs/{logId} {
  userId: string,
  action: string,
  timestamp: timestamp,
  ipAddress: string,
  userAgent: string,
  details: object
}
```

**Security Rules Example:**
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Users can only access their own data
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
      
      // User collections subcollection
      match /collections/{collectionId} {
        allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
      }
    }
    
    // Audit logs are write-only from server
    match /analytics/audit-logs/{logId} {
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
      allow read: if false; // Only server can read
    }
  }
}
```

**Required Indexes:**
- `users` collection: [lastLoginAt] for active user queries
- `users/{userId}/collections`: [collectedAt] for recent items
- `analytics/audit-logs`: [userId, timestamp] for audit queries

**GDPR Compliance Features:**
- Explicit consent collection during registration
- Data export API for user data portability
- Right to deletion with complete data removal
- Data retention policies with automatic cleanup
- Privacy policy with clear data usage explanation

### Testing

**Security Testing:**
- Security rules prevent unauthorized data access
- Authentication requirements work correctly
- User isolation is properly enforced
- Admin-only operations are protected
- Cross-user data access is blocked

**Performance Testing:**
- Database queries perform within acceptable limits (<500ms)
- Indexes improve query performance significantly
- Large dataset operations scale properly
- Concurrent user operations don't cause conflicts
- Real-time listeners perform efficiently

**Compliance Testing:**
- GDPR consent flow captures required information
- Data export includes all user data
- Data deletion removes all traces of user information
- Privacy policy covers all data collection practices
- Audit logs capture required events accurately

**Backup and Recovery Testing:**
- Automated backups complete successfully
- Backup restoration works correctly
- Recovery procedures are documented and tested
- Disaster recovery scenarios are validated
- Data integrity is maintained through backup/restore cycle
