## Dev Notes

**Database Architecture Context:**
- **Primary Database**: Firestore NoSQL with real-time capabilities
- **Security Model**: Firebase Authentication + Firestore Security Rules
- **Data Structure**: Document-based with user subcollections
- **Compliance**: GDPR-ready with data export/deletion capabilities

**Firestore Collection Structure:**
```
users/{userId} {
  uid: string,
  email: string,
  displayName?: string,
  emailVerified: boolean,
  createdAt: timestamp,
  lastLoginAt: timestamp,
  preferences: {
    emailNotifications: boolean,
    theme: 'light' | 'dark',
    language: string
  },
  stats: {
    totalItemsCollected: number,
    completedCollections: number,
    joinDate: timestamp
  },
  subscriptionStatus: 'none' | 'active' | 'cancelled',
  gdprConsent: {
    given: boolean,
    timestamp: timestamp,
    version: string
  }
}

users/{userId}/collections/{collectionId} {
  foodItemId: string,
  collectedAt: timestamp,
  discoveryMethod: string,
  viewedEducationalContent: boolean,
  shared: boolean
}

analytics/audit-logs/{logId} {
  userId: string,
  action: string,
  timestamp: timestamp,
  ipAddress: string,
  userAgent: string,
  details: object
}
```

**Security Rules Example:**
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Users can only access their own data
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
      
      // User collections subcollection
      match /collections/{collectionId} {
        allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
      }
    }
    
    // Audit logs are write-only from server
    match /analytics/audit-logs/{logId} {
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
      allow read: if false; // Only server can read
    }
  }
}
```

**Required Indexes:**
- `users` collection: [lastLoginAt] for active user queries
- `users/{userId}/collections`: [collectedAt] for recent items
- `analytics/audit-logs`: [userId, timestamp] for audit queries

**GDPR Compliance Features:**
- Explicit consent collection during registration
- Data export API for user data portability
- Right to deletion with complete data removal
- Data retention policies with automatic cleanup
- Privacy policy with clear data usage explanation

### Testing

**Security Testing:**
- Security rules prevent unauthorized data access
- Authentication requirements work correctly
- User isolation is properly enforced
- Admin-only operations are protected
- Cross-user data access is blocked

**Performance Testing:**
- Database queries perform within acceptable limits (<500ms)
- Indexes improve query performance significantly
- Large dataset operations scale properly
- Concurrent user operations don't cause conflicts
- Real-time listeners perform efficiently

**Compliance Testing:**
- GDPR consent flow captures required information
- Data export includes all user data
- Data deletion removes all traces of user information
- Privacy policy covers all data collection practices
- Audit logs capture required events accurately

**Backup and Recovery Testing:**
- Automated backups complete successfully
- Backup restoration works correctly
- Recovery procedures are documented and tested
- Disaster recovery scenarios are validated
- Data integrity is maintained through backup/restore cycle

### Issues Identified and Recommendations

#### 🔴 Critical Issues (Must Fix Before Production)
1. **Authentication Context Missing**: No verification of Firebase Auth configuration
2. **Error Tracking Integration**: Performance monitor references missing error tracking service
3. **Production Secrets**: Hardcoded project IDs and configuration values need environment variable management

#### 🟡 Medium Priority Issues
1. **Rate Limiting**: No client-side rate limiting for security rules
2. **Cache Implementation**: In-memory caching in performance monitor needs Redis/external cache for production
3. **Notification Service**: Backup notification system incomplete (placeholder implementation)
4. **Testing Coverage**: No unit or integration tests found for security rules and database services

#### 🔵 Low Priority Enhancements
1. **Query Optimization**: Add automatic query performance suggestions
2. **Monitoring Dashboard**: Implement real-time monitoring dashboard for database operations
3. **Advanced Security**: Consider implementing anomaly detection for suspicious user patterns
4. **Documentation**: Add API documentation for database services

---

### Testing Recommendations

#### Immediate Testing Required
1. **Security Rule Testing**: Test all security rules with Firebase emulator
2. **GDPR Flow Testing**: End-to-end testing of data export/deletion workflows
3. **Backup/Recovery Testing**: Validate backup and recovery procedures
4. **Performance Testing**: Load testing with realistic data volumes

#### Automated Testing Setup
1. **Unit Tests**: Create tests for validation, user service, and GDPR services
2. **Integration Tests**: Test complete user flows with security rules
3. **Security Tests**: Automated penetration testing for data access controls
4. **Backup Tests**: Automated backup integrity verification

#### Compliance Testing
1. **GDPR Audit**: Third-party GDPR compliance verification
2. **Security Audit**: External security assessment of database and rules
3. **Performance Benchmarking**: Establish baseline performance metrics
