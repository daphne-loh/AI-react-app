## Dev Notes

**Food Item Database Architecture:**
- **Storage**: Firestore for metadata, Cloud Storage for images
- **Content Structure**: Themed packs with individual food items
- **Search**: Algolia integration for advanced search (future enhancement)
- **Images**: Multiple sizes with automatic optimization

**Food Item Document Structure:**
```typescript
interface FoodItem {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  culturalBackground: string;
  recipe?: Recipe;
  imageUrl: string;
  thumbnailUrl: string;
  theme: ThemeCategory;
  rarity: 'common' | 'uncommon' | 'rare' | 'legendary';
  origin: FoodOrigin;
  tags: string[];
  createdAt: Timestamp;
  updatedAt: Timestamp;
  isActive: boolean;
  contentVersion: number;
}

interface Recipe {
  ingredients: string[];
  instructions: string[];
  preparationTime: number;
  servings: number;
  difficulty: 'easy' | 'medium' | 'hard';
  tips?: string[];
}

interface FoodOrigin {
  country: string;
  region?: string;
  culturalPeriod?: string;
  significance: string;
}

type ThemeCategory = 'weird-cursed' | 'global-street' | 'historical-desserts' | 'mythical-foods';
```

**Content Pack Structure:**
```typescript
interface ContentPack {
  id: string;
  theme: ThemeCategory;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  foodItemIds: string[];
  releaseDate: Timestamp;
  isActive: boolean;
  subscriberCount: number;
  createdAt: Timestamp;
}
```

**Database Indexes Required:**
- `food-items`: [theme, rarity, isActive] for filtering
- `food-items`: [tags, isActive] for search
- `food-items`: [createdAt] for recent content
- `content-packs`: [isActive, releaseDate] for current content

**Content Research Guidelines:**
- Verify cultural accuracy through multiple sources
- Ensure respectful representation of food traditions
- Include authentic recipes when available
- Provide historical context for traditional foods
- Cite sources for cultural information
- Avoid stereotypes or oversimplification

**Image Optimization Strategy:**
- Original: High resolution for detail views
- Thumbnail: 200x200 for collection grids
- Card: 400x300 for item cards
- Hero: 800x600 for featured displays
- WebP format with JPEG fallbacks
- Automatic compression based on device capabilities

### Testing

**Content Quality Testing:**
- Cultural accuracy verification through expert review
- Recipe testing for authenticity and clarity
- Image quality and consistency validation
- Educational content readability assessment
- Cultural sensitivity review process

**Database Performance Testing:**
- Query performance with large datasets (1000+ items)
- Index efficiency for complex filtering operations
- Search response times across different query types
- Concurrent access handling for content management
- Real-time update propagation testing

**Content Management Testing:**
- Admin interface functionality across all operations
- Bulk content operations performance and reliability
- Content versioning and rollback capabilities
- Import/export data integrity validation
- Approval workflow process verification

**Integration Testing:**
- Image upload and optimization pipeline testing
- CDN integration and global delivery verification
- Search integration with content database
- Content pack creation and management workflow
- Real-time content updates to user interfaces
