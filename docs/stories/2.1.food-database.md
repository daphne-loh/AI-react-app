# Story 2.1: Food Item Database and Content Management

## Status
**Current Status:** Draft _(owned by scrum-master, editable by scrum-master, dev-agent)_

## Story

**As a** content administrator,  
**I want** to create and manage the food item database with initial themed collections,  
**so that** users have compelling content to collect and learn about.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Firestore database schema designed for food items with fields for name, description, cultural background, recipe, image URL, theme category, and rarity
2. Initial content creation with 25+ food items each across 4 themed packs (weird/cursed foods, global street foods, historical desserts, mythical foods)
3. Content management interface for adding new food items and updating existing ones
4. Image optimization and CDN integration for fast food item image loading
5. Cultural content research and validation ensuring accuracy and cultural sensitivity
6. Database queries optimized for efficient food item retrieval and theme filtering
7. Content versioning system for tracking food item updates and additions
8. Data export/import functionality for content management
9. Food item search and filtering capabilities
10. Content approval workflow for quality assurance

## Dev Notes

**Food Item Database Architecture:**
- **Storage**: Firestore for metadata, Cloud Storage for images
- **Content Structure**: Themed packs with individual food items
- **Search**: Algolia integration for advanced search (future enhancement)
- **Images**: Multiple sizes with automatic optimization

**Food Item Document Structure:**
```typescript
interface FoodItem {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  culturalBackground: string;
  recipe?: Recipe;
  imageUrl: string;
  thumbnailUrl: string;
  theme: ThemeCategory;
  rarity: 'common' | 'uncommon' | 'rare' | 'legendary';
  origin: FoodOrigin;
  tags: string[];
  createdAt: Timestamp;
  updatedAt: Timestamp;
  isActive: boolean;
  contentVersion: number;
}

interface Recipe {
  ingredients: string[];
  instructions: string[];
  preparationTime: number;
  servings: number;
  difficulty: 'easy' | 'medium' | 'hard';
  tips?: string[];
}

interface FoodOrigin {
  country: string;
  region?: string;
  culturalPeriod?: string;
  significance: string;
}

type ThemeCategory = 'weird-cursed' | 'global-street' | 'historical-desserts' | 'mythical-foods';
```

**Content Pack Structure:**
```typescript
interface ContentPack {
  id: string;
  theme: ThemeCategory;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  foodItemIds: string[];
  releaseDate: Timestamp;
  isActive: boolean;
  subscriberCount: number;
  createdAt: Timestamp;
}
```

**Database Indexes Required:**
- `food-items`: [theme, rarity, isActive] for filtering
- `food-items`: [tags, isActive] for search
- `food-items`: [createdAt] for recent content
- `content-packs`: [isActive, releaseDate] for current content

**Content Research Guidelines:**
- Verify cultural accuracy through multiple sources
- Ensure respectful representation of food traditions
- Include authentic recipes when available
- Provide historical context for traditional foods
- Cite sources for cultural information
- Avoid stereotypes or oversimplification

**Image Optimization Strategy:**
- Original: High resolution for detail views
- Thumbnail: 200x200 for collection grids
- Card: 400x300 for item cards
- Hero: 800x600 for featured displays
- WebP format with JPEG fallbacks
- Automatic compression based on device capabilities

### Testing

**Content Quality Testing:**
- Cultural accuracy verification through expert review
- Recipe testing for authenticity and clarity
- Image quality and consistency validation
- Educational content readability assessment
- Cultural sensitivity review process

**Database Performance Testing:**
- Query performance with large datasets (1000+ items)
- Index efficiency for complex filtering operations
- Search response times across different query types
- Concurrent access handling for content management
- Real-time update propagation testing

**Content Management Testing:**
- Admin interface functionality across all operations
- Bulk content operations performance and reliability
- Content versioning and rollback capabilities
- Import/export data integrity validation
- Approval workflow process verification

**Integration Testing:**
- Image upload and optimization pipeline testing
- CDN integration and global delivery verification
- Search integration with content database
- Content pack creation and management workflow
- Real-time content updates to user interfaces
