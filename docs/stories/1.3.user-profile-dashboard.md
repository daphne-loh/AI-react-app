## Dev Notes

**User Profile Architecture Context:**
- **Data Storage**: Firestore user documents with profile information
- **Real-time Updates**: Firestore listeners for live profile updates
- **State Management**: Extend AuthContext with profile data
- **Navigation**: React Router with protected routes

**User Document Structure (Firestore):**
```typescript
interface UserProfile {
  uid: string;
  email: string;
  displayName?: string;
  emailVerified: boolean;
  createdAt: Timestamp;
  lastLoginAt: Timestamp;
  preferences: {
    emailNotifications: boolean;
    theme: 'light' | 'dark';
    language: string;
  };
  stats: {
    totalItemsCollected: number;
    completedCollections: number;
    joinDate: Timestamp;
  };
  subscriptionStatus: 'none' | 'active' | 'cancelled';
}
```

**Component Structure:**
```
src/pages/Dashboard/
├── Dashboard.tsx           # Main dashboard layout
├── WelcomeSection.tsx     # Welcome message and quick stats
├── CollectionPreview.tsx  # Placeholder for collection stats
├── SubscriptionCard.tsx   # Subscription status display
└── QuickActions.tsx       # Common user actions

src/pages/Profile/
├── ProfilePage.tsx        # Profile information display
├── AccountSettings.tsx    # Settings and preferences
├── PasswordChange.tsx     # Password update form
└── PreferencesForm.tsx    # User customization options
```

**Navigation Integration:**
- Protected routes requiring authentication
- Breadcrumb navigation for user orientation
- Mobile-responsive hamburger menu
- Quick access to logout and key features

**Future Integration Points:**
- Collection statistics will connect to Epic 2 (Collection System)
- Subscription status will connect to Epic 3 (Subscription Management)
- User preferences will enhance Epic 4 (Social Features)

### Testing

**Unit Testing:**
- Dashboard components render with correct user data
- Profile editing forms validate input correctly
- Navigation components handle route changes properly
- Loading states display during data fetch operations
- Error boundaries catch and display errors appropriately

**Integration Testing:**
- Firestore user document creation and updates work correctly
- Real-time profile data updates reflect in UI immediately
- Authentication state integrates with profile data
- Navigation protects routes based on authentication status
- Profile changes persist correctly in database

**E2E Testing:**
- Complete user profile management flow works end-to-end
- Dashboard loads properly after authentication
- Mobile navigation functions correctly across devices
- Profile editing saves changes successfully
- Email verification process completes properly

**Accessibility Testing:**
- Screen readers can navigate dashboard and profile sections
- Keyboard navigation works for all interactive elements
- Color contrast meets WCAG AA standards
- Form labels and error messages are properly announced
