# Story 2.3: Collection Progress and Display

## Status
**Current Status:** Draft _(owned by scrum-master, editable by scrum-master, dev-agent)_

## Story

**so that** I can see my achievements and identify what I still need to collect.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Collection display organized by themed packs with visual progress indicators
2. Grid layout showing collected food items with thumbnails and collection dates
3. Empty slots indicating uncollected items within each themed pack
4. Overall collection statistics showing total items, completion percentages, and recent discoveries
5. Filtering and sorting options by theme, collection date, and rarity level
6. Visual badges and achievements for completing themed collections
7. Responsive design ensuring proper display across all device sizes
8. Real-time updates when new items are collected
9. Collection sharing capabilities for social media
10. Search functionality within personal collection

## Dev Notes

**Collection Display Architecture:**
- **Data Source**: Firestore user collections with real-time listeners
- **State Management**: React Context for collection state
- **Grid System**: CSS Grid with Flexbox fallbacks
- **Images**: Lazy loading with intersection observer

**Collection Data Structure:**
```typescript
interface UserCollection {
  userId: string;
  items: CollectedItem[];
  stats: CollectionStats;
  lastUpdated: Timestamp;
}

interface CollectedItem {
  foodItemId: string;
  collectedAt: Timestamp;
  discoveryMethod: 'gachapon' | 'bonus' | 'achievement';
  viewedEducationalContent: boolean;
  shared: boolean;
}

interface CollectionStats {
  totalItems: number;
  completedPacks: string[];
  streakDays: number;
  favoriteTheme: ThemeCategory;
  rareItemsCollected: number;
}
```

**Grid Layout Specifications:**
- Mobile: 2-3 columns with 16px gaps
- Tablet: 4-5 columns with 20px gaps  
- Desktop: 6-8 columns with 24px gaps
- Item cards: 4:3 aspect ratio with rounded corners
- Empty slots: Dashed borders with "?" placeholder

### Testing

**Visual Testing:**
- Grid layout responsiveness across all device sizes
- Progress indicator accuracy and visual appeal
- Loading state and skeleton component functionality
- Achievement badge display and animations
- Collection sharing image generation quality

**Performance Testing:**
- Large collection rendering (1000+ items) performance
- Real-time update efficiency and smooth animations
- Search and filtering response times
- Image lazy loading effectiveness
- Memory usage optimization with large datasets
