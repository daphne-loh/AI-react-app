## Dev Notes

**Detail View Architecture:**
- **Routing**: React Router with dynamic food item IDs
- **Data Loading**: Firestore queries with caching for offline access
- **Images**: Progressive loading with multiple resolutions
- **Content**: Rich text rendering with markdown support

**Food Item Detail Data:**
```typescript
interface FoodItemDetail extends FoodItem {
  detailedHistory: string;
  culturalSignificance: string;
  preparationTraditions: string;
  regionalVariations: RegionalVariation[];
  sources: ContentSource[];
  relatedItems: string[];
  userInteractions: {
    bookmarked: boolean;
    shared: boolean;
    viewedAt: Timestamp;
    viewDuration: number;
  };
}

interface RegionalVariation {
  region: string;
  differences: string;
  localName?: string;
  culturalNotes: string;
}
```

**Performance Considerations:**
- Lazy load detailed content after initial page render
- Cache frequently accessed food items
- Optimize images for different screen densities
- Preload related items for smooth navigation

### Testing

**User Experience Testing:**
- Detail page loading and navigation smoothness
- Image zoom and interaction responsiveness
- Educational content readability and engagement

- Social sharing functionality across platforms

**Performance Testing:**
- Page load times with high-resolution images
