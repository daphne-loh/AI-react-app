**Testing Frameworks and Patterns:**
- **Frontend Testing**: Jest + Testing Library (React ecosystem standard)
- **Integration Testing**: Firebase Emulator Suite for local testing

**Specific Testing Requirements for This Story:**

**Unit Testing:**
- Landing page component renders correctly
- Routing configuration works properly
- Environment variable loading functions correctly
- PWA manifest generates valid JSON

**Integration Testing:**
- Firebase SDK initialization succeeds
- Basic Firebase Auth setup connects properly
- Firestore connection establishes successfully
- Firebase Hosting deployment completes

**E2E Testing:**

- Basic navigation functions across browsers
- Performance meets Core Web Vitals thresholds

**Testing Standards from Architecture:**
- All tests must pass before deployment
- Code coverage target: 80% for new components
- Performance testing: <3 second load time requirement
- Accessibility testing: WCAG AA compliance verification

**Firebase Emulator Testing:**
- Use Firebase Emulator Suite for local development testing
- Test Firebase Auth configuration without real authentication
- Verify Firestore connection and basic security rules
- Test deployment pipeline in emulator environment
