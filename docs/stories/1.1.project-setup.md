# Story 1.1: Project Setup and Initial Deployment

## Status
**Current Status:** Draft _(owned by scrum-master, editable by scrum-master, dev-agent)_

## Story

**As a** developer,  
**I want** to set up the React project with Firebase integration and deploy a basic "coming soon" page,  
**so that** the technical foundation is established and the application is accessible online.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. React application created with Vite and organized folder structure for components, services, and utilities
2. Firebase project configured with Authentication, Firestore, and Hosting services enabled
3. Basic routing structure implemented using React Router for future page navigation
4. "Coming Soon" landing page deployed to Firebase Hosting with custom domain (if available)
5. HTTPS enforced and basic security headers configured
6. PWA manifest file created for future Progressive Web App features
7. Basic CSS framework setup with responsive mobile-first design foundation
8. Environment variables properly configured for development and production
9. TypeScript configured with proper type checking enabled
10. Initial deployment pipeline working with automatic builds

## Dev Notes

**Development Context for Story 1.1:**

**Relevant Architecture Information:**
- **Tech Stack**: React 18.x with Vite 5.x build tool, TypeScript 5.x, Firebase Latest, Tailwind CSS 3.x
- **Repository Structure**: Monorepo with npm workspaces, apps/web/ for frontend application
- **Platform**: Firebase + Vercel deployment (Firebase for backend, Vercel for frontend hosting per architecture)
- **Mobile-First**: PWA requirements with offline capabilities and app-like experience

**Project Structure from Architecture:**
```
apps/web/
├── src/
│   ├── components/common/     # Reusable UI components
│   ├── pages/                 # Route components  
│   ├── services/              # API client services
│   ├── stores/                # Context providers
│   ├── styles/                # Global styles/Tailwind config
│   └── utils/                 # Frontend utilities
├── public/                    # Static assets, PWA manifest
└── package.json
```

**Firebase Services Configuration:**
- **Authentication**: Email/password, prepare for future social login
- **Firestore**: NoSQL database for users, food-items, collections
- **Hosting**: Primary deployment target with automatic SSL
- **Storage**: Food item images (future stories)

**Environment Variables Required:**
```bash
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=
```

**PWA Requirements:**
- Service worker for offline capability
- App manifest with FoodDrop branding
- Mobile-optimized icons (192px, 512px)
- Touch-friendly interface preparation

**Deployment Strategy:**
- Firebase Hosting for static React build
- Automatic HTTPS enforcement
- Future: Vercel for frontend, Firebase for backend services

### Testing

**Test File Locations:**
- Unit tests: `apps/web/tests/components/` for component tests
- Integration tests: `apps/web/tests/integration/` for Firebase integration
- E2E tests: `tests/e2e/` (project root) for deployment verification

**Testing Frameworks and Patterns:**
- **Frontend Testing**: Jest + Testing Library (React ecosystem standard)
- **Integration Testing**: Firebase Emulator Suite for local testing
- **E2E Testing**: Playwright for cross-browser deployment verification
- **Test Organization**: Co-located test files with `.test.tsx` suffix

**Specific Testing Requirements for This Story:**

**Unit Testing:**
- Landing page component renders correctly
- Routing configuration works properly
- Environment variable loading functions correctly
- PWA manifest generates valid JSON

**Integration Testing:**
- Firebase SDK initialization succeeds
- Basic Firebase Auth setup connects properly
- Firestore connection establishes successfully
- Firebase Hosting deployment completes

**E2E Testing:**
- Deployed site loads successfully in mobile browsers
- HTTPS enforcement works correctly
- PWA installation prompt appears on mobile
- Basic navigation functions across browsers
- Performance meets Core Web Vitals thresholds

**Testing Standards from Architecture:**
- All tests must pass before deployment
- Code coverage target: 80% for new components
- Performance testing: <3 second load time requirement
- Accessibility testing: WCAG AA compliance verification

**Firebase Emulator Testing:**
- Use Firebase Emulator Suite for local development testing
- Test Firebase Auth configuration without real authentication
- Verify Firestore connection and basic security rules
- Test deployment pipeline in emulator environment
