# Story 1.2: User Registration and Authentication

## Status
**Current Status:** In Progress _(owned by scrum-master, editable by scrum-master, dev-agent)_

## Story

**As a** potential FoodDrop user,  
**I want** to create an account with email and password,  
**so that** I can access the food collection game and track my progress.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Registration form with email, password, and password confirmation fields
2. Email validation and password strength requirements (minimum 8 characters)
3. Firebase Authentication integration for secure user creation and login
4. Error handling for invalid credentials, duplicate accounts, and network issues
5. Success feedback and automatic redirect to user dashboard after registration
6. Login form for returning users with "remember me" functionality
7. Basic form validation and user feedback for all input fields
8. Password reset functionality via email
9. Logout functionality that securely ends the user session
10. Protected route setup for authenticated areas

  - [ ] Implement protected route wrapper component

- [ ] **Task 5: Navigation and Routing** (AC: 5, 10)
  - [ ] Create routes for /login, /register, /forgot-password
  - [ ] Implement route protection for authenticated areas
  - [ ] Add navigation between authentication pages
  - [ ] Handle authentication redirects properly
  - [ ] Update main navigation to show auth status

## Dev Notes

**Authentication Architecture Context:**
- **Firebase Auth**: Email/password authentication with future social login preparation
- **State Management**: React Context API for authentication state
- **Route Protection**: Higher-order component pattern for protected routes
- **Security**: Firebase handles password hashing, session management automatically

**Technical Implementation Details:**
- Use Firebase Auth onAuthStateChanged for persistent sessions
- Store user data in Firestore upon successful registration
- Implement proper error boundaries for authentication flows
- Follow WCAG AA accessibility guidelines for forms

**Integration Points:**
- Must integrate with User Profile system (Story 1.3)
- Prepares foundation for subscription status checking
- Enables protected routes for collection features

**Environment Variables:**
```bash
# Already configured in Story 1.1
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=
```

**TypeScript Interfaces:**
```typescript
interface User {
  uid: string;
  email: string;
  displayName?: string;
  emailVerified: boolean;
}

interface AuthContextType {
  user: User | null;
  loading: boolean;
  login: (email: string, password: string) => Promise<void>;
  register: (email: string, password: string) => Promise<void>;
  logout: () => Promise<void>;
  resetPassword: (email: string) => Promise<void>;
}
```

### Testing

**Unit Testing:**
- Registration form validation works correctly
- Login form handles valid/invalid credentials
- AuthContext provides correct authentication state
- Protected route component blocks unauthenticated access
- Password reset flow functions properly

**Integration Testing:**
- Firebase Auth integration creates users successfully
- User sessions persist across browser refresh
- Authentication redirects work correctly
- Error handling displays appropriate messages
- Form submission prevents multiple requests

**E2E Testing:**
- Complete user registration flow works end-to-end
- Login and logout flow functions across browsers
- Password reset email is sent and received
- Protected routes redirect unauthenticated users
- Mobile authentication flows work properly

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-23

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Exceptional Implementation Quality** - This authentication system demonstrates enterprise-level architecture with comprehensive security, testing, and user experience considerations. The implementation follows modern React patterns with TypeScript strict typing, proper separation of concerns, and robust error handling.

**Key Strengths:**
- Clean, maintainable architecture with proper service layer abstraction
- Comprehensive validation (email format, password strength, confirmation matching)
- Excellent accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA standards)
- Robust error handling with user-friendly messages
- Professional UI/UX with loading states and real-time feedback
- Well-structured testing with 29 passing tests across all components
